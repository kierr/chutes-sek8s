# sek8s

Confidential GPU infrastructure for Chutes miners and zero-trust workloads. This monorepo bundles everything you need to build, attest, launch, and operate Intel TDX VMs with NVIDIA GPUs—including the host orchestration scripts, the guest image builder, and ready-to-run documentation.

## What's in this repo?

| Directory | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **`guest-tools/`** | Build the encrypted TDX VM image with k3s, attestation services, and GPU drivers |
| **`host-tools/`** | Set up the host machine and launch the TDX VM (GPU binding, networking, volume management) |
| **`docs/`** | Integration guide with [chutes-miner](https://github.com/chutesai/chutes-miner) and system-status service documentation |
| `ansible/k3s/` | Ansible roles for guest image build automation |
| `sek8s/`, `nvevidence/` | Python services running inside the guest (attestation, evidence verification, system status) |
| `tdx/` | Submodule with Intel's TDX host enablement scripts |

## Quick start roadmap

1. **Set up the host** — Use [`host-tools/`](host-tools/) to prepare your TDX-capable machine with the required kernel, PCCS, GPU bindings, and networking.
2. **Understand the integration** — Read [`docs/end-to-end-miner.md`](docs/end-to-end-miner.md) to see how this repo integrates with the [chutes-miner](https://github.com/chutesai/chutes-miner) control plane.
3. **Build the guest image** — Use [`guest-tools/`](guest-tools/) and [`ansible/k3s/`](ansible/k3s/) to customize or rebuild the encrypted VM image.
4. **Monitor VM status** — See [`docs/system-status.md`](docs/system-status.md) for using the system-status API to inspect service health and GPU telemetry inside the VM.

4. **Monitor VM status** — See [`docs/system-status.md`](docs/system-status.md) for using the system-status API to inspect service health and GPU telemetry inside the VM.

Launch the VM with `host-tools/scripts/quick-launch.sh` to bind GPUs, create volumes, and boot the VM in one command.

> **Important:** The guest root disk is LUKS-encrypted. Only the Chutes attestation/key service (or your own compatible service) can decrypt it after verifying Intel TDX measurements, so simply possessing the qcow2 image is not enough to run the VM.

### How this repo pairs with `chutes-miner`

- **Guest image:** Built with `guest-tools/` and `ansible/k3s/`, contains the full Chutes stack pre-installed.
- **Host operations:** Use `host-tools/` to launch and manage the TDX VM on bare metal.
- **Control plane:** The [chutes-miner](https://github.com/chutesai/chutes-miner) repo manages your fleet of miners (both TEE and non-TEE) via `chutes-miner-cli`.
- **Integration:** See [`docs/end-to-end-miner.md`](docs/end-to-end-miner.md) for how the pieces fit together.

> **Note:** TEE VMs have no SSH access. Use the `chutes-miner-cli` for management and the system-status API (see [`docs/system-status.md`](docs/system-status.md)) for read-only monitoring.
