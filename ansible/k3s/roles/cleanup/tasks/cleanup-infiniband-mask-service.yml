# Enable infiniband-mask at runtime (align with gpu-verify, verify-storage).
# The service runs at every boot and dynamically detects Mellanox devices:
# if present, IB services run normally; if absent, they are masked to avoid errors.
# Same VM image is used for all topologies (B200 with IB, H200 without, etc).
