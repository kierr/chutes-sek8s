# Secure Kubernetes TDX VM Builder

This Ansible automation builds production-ready Intel TDX (Trust Domain Extensions) virtual machine images for trustless, distributed computing networks. The resulting VMs provide hardware-enforced confidential computing with comprehensive attestation capabilities.

## Overview

The build process creates a hardened Ubuntu VM image with:

- **Intel TDX confidential computing** - Hardware-isolated execution environment
- **Full-disk LUKS encryption** - Root filesystem encrypted, unlocked via TDX attestation API
- **Kubernetes (k3s)** - Lightweight container orchestration
- **NVIDIA GPU support** - H200 GPU passthrough with attestation (PPCIe mode)
- **Admission control** - OPA-based policy enforcement preventing privilege escalation
- **Attestation services** - TDX quote generation and GPU evidence verification
- **Dynamic configuration** - Node identity and network config loaded from verified volumes at boot

## Architecture

### Attestation-Based Boot

1. VM boots with encrypted root filesystem
2. TDX quote generated with nonce from attestation API
3. Quote verified by remote service, LUKS key returned
4. Configuration volume validated and applied
5. Services start with hardware-attested identity

### Security Layers

- **Hardware isolation** - Intel TDX enforces memory encryption and isolation
- **Admission controller** - Validates all Kubernetes workloads before scheduling
- **Seccomp profiles** - System call filtering to prevent container escapes
- **Network policies** - Restrict pod-to-pod and pod-to-service communication
- **Certificate-based authentication** - mTLS for attestation service access

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Ubuntu 22.04/24.04 host with KVM support
sudo apt install ansible libvirt-daemon-system qemu-utils
ansible-galaxy collection install community.general kubernetes.core ansible.posix
```

### Environment Setup

```bash
# Required: LUKS encryption passphrase
export LUKS_PASSPHRASE="your-secure-passphrase"

# Optional: Attestation endpoints
export ATTESTATION_ENDPOINT="https://api.example.com/attestation"
export TDX_NONCE_ENDPOINT="https://api.example.com/nonce"
```

### Build Image

```bash
cd ansible/k3s
ansible-playbook playbooks/site.yml
```

The build process:
1. Launches temporary VM from base Ubuntu cloud image
2. Installs and configures k3s, GPU drivers, attestation services
3. Applies security hardening and admission policies
4. Encrypts root filesystem with LUKS
5. Configures initramfs for TDX-based boot unlock
6. Outputs final encrypted image at `guest-tools/image/tdx-guest-ubuntu-24.04-final.qcow2`

## Deployment

The built image requires TDX-capable host infrastructure. See `host-tools/README.md` for complete deployment instructions including:

- TDX host setup and kernel configuration
- GPU binding and PPCIe mode configuration
- Network setup (bridge or macvtap modes - **NAT is supported**)
- Config and cache volume creation (automated by host tools)
- VM launch with GPU passthrough

### Network Modes

The VM supports both dedicated public IP and NAT configurations:

- **Bridge mode** - Private bridge network with NAT and port forwarding
- **Macvtap mode** - Direct attachment to physical interface

Host tools automatically configure iptables rules for k3s API (port 6443) and NodePort services (30000-32767).

### Configuration Volumes

Production VMs require two attached volumes (created by host tools):

#### Config Volume (`tdx-config`)
- **Created by**: `host-tools/scripts/create-config.sh`
- **Filesystem**: ext4 with label `tdx-config`
- **Mount point**: `/var/config`
- **Contents**:
  - `hostname` - Node hostname
  - `miner-ss58` - Bittensor SS58 address
  - `miner-seed` - Bittensor secret seed
  - `network-config.yaml` - Netplan configuration

#### Cache Volume (`tdx-cache`)
- **Created by**: `host-tools/scripts/create-cache.sh`
- **Filesystem**: ext4 with label `tdx-cache`
- **Mount point**: `/var/snap`
- **Purpose**: Persistent storage for model caches, container images
- **Size**: Configurable (default 5TB / 5000GB)

Both volumes are validated at boot. Missing or invalid volumes trigger immediate shutdown.

## Key Components

### Attestation Service (`/opt/sek8s`)
- Generates TDX quotes with report data
- Combines TDX attestation with NVIDIA GPU evidence
- Exposes internal (authenticated) and external (validator) endpoints
- Implements nonce-based replay protection

### Admission Controller
- Validates all pod specifications against OPA policies
- Enforces registry allowlists with cosign signature verification
- Prevents privileged containers and dangerous capabilities
- Blocks namespace manipulation and webhook modifications

### K3s Initialization
- `k3s-config-init` - Generates node configuration with TLS SANs
- `k3s-cluster-init` - Runs post-boot setup scripts:
  - Node cleanup and labeling
  - Certificate generation for remote access
  - Miner credential injection

## Customization

Key configuration in `playbooks/group_vars/all.yml`:

- `k3s_version` - Kubernetes version
- `cuda_version` / `nvidia_version` - GPU driver versions  
- `validator` - Allowed validator SS58 address
- `attestation_endpoint` - Remote attestation service URL

See role-specific defaults for component configuration.
